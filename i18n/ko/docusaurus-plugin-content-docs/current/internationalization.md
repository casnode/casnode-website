Casnode supports multi-languages, by deploying the translations to Crowdin, we support Chinese, French, German, Russian, Japanese and Korean.

Casnode uses the official Crowdin cli to sync translations from Crowdin, if you want to add more languages supports, please propose in [our community](https://github.com/casbin/casnode), and if you want to help us speed up the translating work, please help us translate on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/casnode).
