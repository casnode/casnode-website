## Install casnode through docker  
### Prepare work
#### Install docker and docker-compose
Install Docker and Docker-compose, you see [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
<br/>

#### Clone casnode & casdoor
Next, clone Casdoor and Casndoe from GitHub.    
```shell
git clone https://github.com/casbin/casdoor.git
git clone https://github.com/casbin/casnode.git
```
Now, you can see two folders, casnode and casdoor.
<br/>

#### Create network

Casdoor and Casnode need to be deployed on the same network

You can create bridge network like this command

```shell
docker network create -d bridge casdoor
```

### Configure casdoor

#### Run casdoor
We first configure casdoor.
```shell
cd casdoor
vim conf/app.conf
```
Modify `dataSourceName = root:123456@tcp(localhost:3306)/ ` to `dataSourceName = root:123456@tcp(db:3306)/`. (Because mysql `root` pwd will be set to `123456`, you can modify it at `docker-compose.yml`)

Then edit `docker-compose.yml`, set containers to the network you create.

Here is an example:

```yaml
version: '3.1'
services:
  casdoor:
    restart: always
    build:
      context: ./
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      RUNNING_IN_DOCKER: "true"
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
    volumes:
      - ./conf:/conf/
    networks:
      - casdoor

  db:
    restart: always
    image: mysql:8.0.25
    platform: linux/amd64
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: 123456
    volumes:
      - /usr/local/docker/mysql:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - casdoor

networks:
  casdoor:
    external:
      name: casdoor
```

Then start casdoor with docker-compose

```shell
docker-compose up
```
<br/>

:::tip
mysql and casdoor are in different docker containers.

#### Configure casnode in casdoor
Now that Casdoor has been configured, visit http://your-ip:8000 to configure Casnode.  

The default administrator login account is ```admin/123```.

Click Organization, then click Add, click Edit for the added organization, and change the name to the organization name you want. Here I set it to casbin-forum, and then click Save.

Click Applications, then click Add, for the application you just added, click Edit, change the name to the application name you want, I changed it to app-casbin-forum.Click on the organization, select the organization you just added, my organization  is casbin- forum. Click Redirect URLs, modify the link in the box to `http://your-ip:7000/callback`.Finally, remember the Client ID and Client Secret, and click Save. 

Click Users, click Add, then click Edit, modify the added user, click Organization, select casbin-forum, and click is admin. Finally click Save, now your organization has an administrator account.
<br/>

### Configure casnode
Next we configure in Casnode.

edit `./conf/app.conf`

Modify `dataSourceName = root:123456@tcp(localhost:3306)/` to `dataSourceName = root:123456@tcp(db:3306)/` so that the data come from your database.

Then find `casdoorEndpoint`, modify it to `http://your-ip:8000` (Casdoor backend address), find `clientId` and `clientSecret`, and modify them to the previously remembered Application client id and client secret, find `casdoorOrganization`, modify the organization name to you set. 

edit `./web/src/Conf.js`

modify `serverUrl` to http://your-ip:8000 (Casdoor front-end access address), modify `clientId` to the clientId of the application just added, modify `appname` to the set application name, and modify the `organization` to the set organization name. 

Next, you need edit `docker-compose.yml`

You just need to configure it like casdoor and deploy containers in the network you created, here is an example:

```
version: '3.1'
services:
  casnode:
    build:
      context: ./
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
     - "7000:7000"
    volumes:
      - ./conf:/conf/
    networks:
      - casnode

networks:
  casnode:
    external: 
      name: casdoor
```

Next visit http://your-ip:7000, click login, enter the account you added before, user_1/123, you have now successfully logged in to Casnode.
