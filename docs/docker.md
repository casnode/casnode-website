## Install casnode through docker
### Prepare work
#### Install docker and docker-compose
Install Docker and Docker-compose, you see [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

#### Clone casnode & casdoor
Next, clone Casdoor and Casndoe from GitHub.    
```shell
git clone https://github.com/casbin/casdoor.git
git clone https://github.com/casbin/casnode.git
```
Now, you can see two folders, `casnode` and `casdoor`.

### Configure casdoor

#### Run casdoor
We first configure casdoor.

Edit `conf/app.conf`, modify **dataSourceName = root:123@tcp(localhost:3306)/ to dataSourceName = root:123@tcp(db:3306)/**
```shell
docker-compose up
```

:::tip

mysql and casdoor are in different docker containers.

#### Configure casnode in casdoor
Now that Casdoor has been configured, visit http://your-ip:8000 to configure Casnode.  

The default administrator login account is ```admin/123```.

Click Organization, then click Add, click Edit for the added organization, and change the name to the organization name you want. Here I set it to casbin-forum, and then click Save.

Click Applications, then click Add, for the application you just added, click Edit, change the name to the application name you want, I changed it to app-casbin-forum.Click on the organization, select the organization you just added, my organization  is casbin- forum. Click Redirect URLs, modify the link in the box to `http://your-ip:7000/callback`.Finally, remember the Client ID and Client Secret, and click Save. 

Click Users, click Add, then click Edit, modify the added user, click Organization, select casbin-forum, and click is admin. Finally click Save, now your organization has an administrator account.

Edit `conf/app.conf`, modify **dataSourceName = root:123@tcp(localhost:3306)/** to **dataSourceName = root:123@tcp(db:3306)/** so that the data come from your database.

Then find `casdoorEndpoint`, modify it to `http://your-ip:8000` (Casdoor backend address), find `clientId` and `clientSecret`, and modify them to the previously remembered Application client id and client secret, find casdoorOrganization, modify the organization name to you set.

Edit `web/src/Conf.js` , modify `serverUrl` to http://your-ip:8000 (Casdoor front-end access address), modify `clientId` to the clientId of the application just added, modify `appName` to the set application name, and modify `organizationName` to the set organization name.
